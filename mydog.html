            <h3>About My Dog</h3>

            <p>He is a 2.5 year old American Staffordshire Terrier & German Shepherd mix. He loves chasing balls in my backyard and going to the various dog parks around Madison. When he "plays fetch" he likes to keep a ball in his mouth at all times so playing with him requires at minimum two balls. He is a sucker for food and will do anything for it and he's also a people pleaser. Sometimes I wonder if he likes meeting new people more than he likes me. </p>
